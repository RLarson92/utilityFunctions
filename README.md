# Utility Functions

Partially for myself and to make sharing with others easier, I have this repo full of utility functions. "Function" should be interpreted loosely; some of the files are true functions, while others are annotated code blocks that perform a useful task.

The functions are organized into the different folders above based on what they do:

**calculations:** perform some kind of calculation.

**dataWrangling:** manipulate data or data tables. Includes scripts that save R data for use with other programs
