# Utility Functions

Partially for myself and to make sharing with others easier, I have this repo full of utility functions. "Function" should be interpreted loosely; some of the files are true functions, while others are annotated code blocks that perform a useful task.

The functions are organized into the different folders above based on what they do:
** calculations:** functions or scripts that perform some kind of calculation.
** dataWrangling:** functions or scripts that manipulate data or data tables.
